//The Math.log() function in JavaScript is used to return the natural logarithm (base e) of a number. The JavaScript Math.log() function is equivalent to ln(x) in mathematics.
// If the value of x is negative, then math.log() function return NaN.
// log() is a static method of Math, therefore, it is always used as Math.log(), rather than as a method of a Math object created.

console.log(Math.log(80));
